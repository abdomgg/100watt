        <h2 class="oe_slogan">Purchase Order Pending Approval</h2>
        <p class="oe_mt32"> When a buyer creates or confirms a purchase order, it automatically enters
            the "Pending Approval" state. The purchase order cannot be confirmed until an approver reviews
            and approves it. Approvers receive activities in their dashboard for quick action. </p>

            The approval action automatically confirms the purchase order, while rejection returns it to
            draft state for modifications. All actions are tracked and logged. </p>
